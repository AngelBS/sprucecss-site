<p class="lead">We try to make Spruce CSS smaller but still, we talk about 1000+ lines of code. Sometimes we donâ€™t need all of them.</p>

This framework only writes out any code if we tell it explicitly through a mixin. We call these mixins generators. We can control the size of our codebase by using or omitting them.

Usually, we use the following two:

```scss
@use 'sprucecss/scss/spruce';

@include spruce.generate-content;
@include spruce.generate-form;
```

You can see that from the [source code](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/blob/main/scss/mixin/_generator.scss) that these two mixins generate a lot smaller ones which we can utilize.

If you only need one type of button and nothing more from the forms, you can use the following:

```scss
@use 'sprucecss/scss/spruce';

@include spruce.generate-content;
@include spruce.generate-btn('.btn');

.btn--primary { @include spruce.btn-variant(primary); }
```

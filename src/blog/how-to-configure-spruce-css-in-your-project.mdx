A config setting is needed to set your custom values and generate Spruce’s styles.

We can utilize Sass’s newer [index file feature](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#index-files).

Create a **config** folder inside your **scss** folder. We need an **_index.scss**, a **_config.scss**, and a **_styles.scss** file in this folder. Inside the **_index.scss** file, we forward the others to our main entry point (that we compile into a single CSS file) **main.scss**, which is in the root of the `scss` folder.

```scss
.
└── scss/
    ├── config/
    │   ├── _index.scss
    │   ├── _config.scss
    │   └── _styles.scss
    └── main.scss
```
## _index.scss

In this file, we just forward all of the config files.

```scss
@forward 'config';
@forward 'styles';
```

## _config.scss

Inside the** _config.scss** file, we set our Spruce CSS customizations as you see under the [settings](/docs/customization/settings) and [variables](/docs/sass/variables).

```scss
@use 'sprucecss/scss/spruce' with (
  $colors: (
    card: (
      background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%),
      border: hsl(220 32% 87%)
    )
  )
);
```

## _styles.scss

Inside the **_styles.scss** file, we set the [generators](/docs/elements/generators). Usually, this means the `generate-content` and `generate-form`, but we can do it any way we want.

```scss
@use 'sprucecss/scss/spruce';

@include spruce.generate-content;
@include spruce.generate-form;
```

## main.scss

For the complete picture, we include the main file here, where the first step is loading the config.

```scss
@forward 'config';
// @forward 'components';
```

## The Advantages of This Structure
- You separated every config-related code inside one folder, which is always nice.
- For example, you can easily extend this structure in the future if you need another theme, like a dark one.
- You can load the config in multiple files, which are usually handy (or just the **_config.scss**).

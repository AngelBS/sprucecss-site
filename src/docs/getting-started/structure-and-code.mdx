title: 'Structure and Code'
---

<p class="lead">Spruce tries to be customizable and straightforward. On this page, you can find some core principles and the structure.</p>

## Coding Style Guide and Practices

- Where it is possible, we use elements and/or attributes to style elements, but it is still a class-based framework.
- We use Stylelint with a [modified configuration](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/blob/main/.stylelintrc.json) with [stylelint-config-sass-guidelines](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-sass-guidelines) preset to quality control.
- We alphabetize the property declaration order. It is practical, no joke.
- We use mostly BEM when a more complicated structure is necessary.
- We try not to use px as units. Right now, it is only present at border values.

## Developing with Spruce

Spruce uses npm scripts to compile Sass and to do other tasks. You can see all of the scripts in the [package.json file](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/blob/main/package.json).

**Our two main scripts are:**

- ```npm run dev``` is for development purposes. It will fire up the development preview, a pug-based, simple HTML page where you can see all the styled elements.
- ```npm run prod``` is for production. It will create the right compiled CSS files.

## The Structure of the Project

You can find the main code under the ```scss``` folder at the root. The ```.vscode``` folder contains a VS Code configuration file. The ```preview``` folder is a developer helper where we can see the effect of the modification right away.

```scss
sprucecss/
├─ .vscode/
├─ css/               // Compiled CSS folder
│  ├─ spruce.css
│  ├─ spruce.min.css
├─ preview/           // Spruce preview for development
│  ├─ ...
├─ scss/              // Source .scss files, Spruce CSS itself
│  ├─ form/
│  ├─ function/
│  ├─ mixin/
│  ├─ variable/
│  ├─ ...
│  ├─ spruce.scss
├─ .gitignore
├─ package.json
├─ README.md
├─ ...
```

## Browser Support

Spruce uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) with the [default configurations](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#best-practices).

The browser support is not set in stone, but one of the goals of this framework is to be a modern one. We will plan to support new features early, but we understand the browser landscape is not so simple. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/issues/new) if you have any questions or ideas regarding this topic.

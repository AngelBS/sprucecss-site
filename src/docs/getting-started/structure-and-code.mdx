<p class="lead">Spruce tries to be customizable and straightforward. On this page, you can find some core principles and the structure.</p>

## Coding Style Guide and Practices

- Where it is possible, we use elements and/or attributes to style elements, but it is still a class-based framework.
- We use Stylelint with a [modified configuration](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/blob/main/.stylelintrc.json) with [stylelint-config-sass-guidelines](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-sass-guidelines) preset to quality control.
- We [alphabetize](https://jerrylowm.medium.com/alphabetize-your-css-properties-for-crying-out-loud-780eb1852153) the property declaration order. It is practical, no joke.
- We use mostly BEM when a more complicated structure is necessary.
- We try not to use px as units. Right now, it is only present at border values.
- We use modern Sass with `@use` and `@forward`.

## BEM (Block Element Modifier)

For writing complex components, we use [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/), a simple naming convention that helps to create manageable code. A simple example looks like this:

- Block: a component element, like `.btn`.
- Element: a child element of the component like `.btn__icon`.
- Modifier: a flag that someway modifies the component like `.btn--primary`.

## Class vs. Classless Frameworks

A classless framework doesn’t specify classes and special markup for your elements. You use regular HTML elements. The advantage is that you only need to load a CSS file and get many styling right away.

We think this approach has more problems in the long run, so we use classes. Of course, we also style just elements where it is convenient (like text-related elements).

## The Source Code of Spruce

Spruce uses npm scripts to compile Sass and to do other tasks. You can see all of the scripts in the [package.json file](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/blob/main/package.json).

**Our two main scripts are:**

- `npm run dev` is for development purposes. It will fire up the development preview (which is a sandbox for us), a pug-based, simple HTML page where you can see all the styled elements.
- `npm run prod` is for production. It will create the right compiled CSS files.

### The Structure of the Project

You can find the main code under the `scss` folder at the root. The `.vscode` folder contains a VS Code configuration file. The `preview` folder is a developer helper where we can see the effect of the modification right away.

```scss
sprucecss/
├─ .vscode/
├─ css/               // Compiled CSS folder
│  ├─ spruce.css
│  ├─ spruce.min.css
├─ preview/           // Spruce preview for development
│  ├─ ...
├─ scss/              // Source .scss files, Spruce CSS itself
│  ├─ form/
│  ├─ function/
│  ├─ mixin/
│  ├─ variable/
│  ├─ ...
│  ├─ spruce.scss
├─ .gitignore
├─ package.json
├─ README.md
├─ ...
```

## Browser Support

Spruce uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) with the [default configurations](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#best-practices).

The browser support is not set in stone, but one of the goals of this framework is to be a modern one. We will plan to support new features early, but we understand the browser landscape is not so simple. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/issues/new) if you have any questions or ideas regarding this topic.

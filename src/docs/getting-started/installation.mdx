<p className="lead">Spruce CSS is built on Sass; to get the full potential, you should use with it. If you want, you can load the compiled CSS too, but you will lose many features.</p>

## Install with NPM

```bash
npm install sprucecss --save
```

## Install with Yarn

```bash
yarn add sprucecss
```

## Install Manually

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), find the dist folder at the root (where are the compiled files), and use the preferred CSS file (minified, regular).

```html
<link href="sprucecss.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="sprucecss.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Import It With @use

To import it into your project, you must use Sass’s ```@use```, a newer type of ```@import``` that is similar to the JavaScript modules. Unlike using @import, you have to import it in every file where you want to use Spruce, its variables, functions, or mixins.

``` scss
@use '~sprucecss/scss/spruce';
```

The @use rule loads the mixins, functions, and variables in a namespaced way. If you use the import above, you can refer to the Spruce assets using the “spruce” namespace like so:

```scss
.section {
  @include spruce.layout-stack(spruce.spacer(m));
}
```

We include the ```layout-stack``` mixin in this example and use the ```spacer``` function to get the “m” sized spacer.

If you don’t want to use namespacing, you have to import like the following:

```scss
@use '~sprucecss/scss/spruce' as *;
```

Although the namespacing doesn’t necessary for a simple project, we will show you the examples this way because we like the idea and think it is more future proof.

<p className="lead">Spruce CSS is built on Sass; to get the full potential, you should use with it. If you want, you can load the compiled CSS too, but you will lose many features.</p>

## Install with NPM

```
npm install sprucecss --save
```

## Install with Yarn

```
yarn add sprucecss
```

## Install Manually

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), find the dist folder at the root (where are the compiled files), and use the preferred CSS file (minified, regular).

```html
<link href="sprucecss.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="sprucecss.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Import It With @use

To import it into your project, you must use Sass’s ```@use```, a newer type of ```@import``` that is similar to the JavaScript modules. Unlike using @import, you have to import it in every file where you want to use Spruce, its variables, functions, or mixins.

``` scss
@use '~sprucecss/scss/spruce';
```

<p className="lead">Spruce uses Sass to generate CSS code. Sass is a popular and mature CSS extension language that lets us write stylesheets more programmatically.</p>

## Is Sass Needed to Use Spruce?

Yes, it is. Spruce uses few utility classes. It uses [mixins](http://localhost:8000/docs/sass/mixins), [functions](http://localhost:8000/docs/sass/functions), and [variables](http://localhost:8000/docs/sass/variables) (both Sass and CSS custom properties) to give a better development experience.

## Why Use Sass?

Well, for this question, there is a lot of reasonable answers. In this case, we like the idea of generating only as much code as we need. With this, Sass is a great help:
- using mixins and functions, we can create valuable helpers.
- It is a framework (of some sort); it has to be expandable and modifiable.

## Dart Sass, @use and @forward

The spruce framework uses the newest Dart Sass. Sass is a tool with great support and development, so following the latest recommendations is always good.

For example, the @import statement is now deprecated, and the [@use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use), [@forward](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward), takes its place.

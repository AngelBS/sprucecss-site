<p class="lead">Inclusivity and accessibility (A11Y) are some of the main concerns of Spruce CSS. Our goal is to help you develop a little more accessible web-based projects through our code and the documentation, where we will try to show you small, related tips and guidance where necessary.</p>

Building something more inclusive is a long process. We learn on the way, too, so this is especially a work in progress.

## WCAG 2.1

Our primary reference is the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) level AA. By alone, as a CSS framework, Spruce canâ€™t tackle too much of this reference, but we will follow this standard in Spruce UI too, where it will have more significance.

## Integrated Inclusivity

We will meet the following accessibility-related issues:

- The base colors and the base combinations will complete the color contrast guides.
- We respect the user settings through `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-color-scheme`.
- We care about semantics and will try to present the code examples more meaningfully.

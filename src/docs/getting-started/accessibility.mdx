title: 'Inclusivity and Accessibility'
---

<p class="lead">Inclusivity and accessibility (A11Y) are some of the main concerns of Spruce. Our goal is to help you develop a little more accessible web-based projects through our code and the documentation, where we will try to show you small, related tips and guidence where it is possible.</p>

## WCAG 2.1

Our primary reference is the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) level AA. By alone, as a CSS framework, Spruce canâ€™t tackle too much of this reference, but we will follow this standard in Spruce UI too, where it will have more significance.

## Integrated Inclusivity

We will meet the following accessibility-related issues:

- The base colors and the base combinations will complete the color contrast guides.
- We respect the user settings through ```prefers-reduced-motion``` and ```prefers-color-scheme```.
- We care about semantic and will try present the code, examples in a more meaningful way.

title: 'Internationalization'
---

<p class="lead">Internationalization (i18n) means preparing the code, design to handle different languages and writing modes.</p>

The simplest example is the right-to-left (RTL) writing mode used by Arabic and Hebrew languages, among others. When you write RTL, you should mirror (simplified) your site: your logo in the header moves to the right side, and all of your layout and text alignment also similarly change place.

## Logical Properties and Values

CSS Logical Properties and Values is a newer CSS module to control the layout logically. Instead of physical left or right values, we have logical left or right, depending on the writing mode.

Spruce uses these logical properties and values, but this is a new feature for us too.

title: 'Internationalization'

<p class="lead">Internationalization (i18n) means to prepare you code, design to handle different languages and writing modes.</p>

The simplest example is the right-to-left (RTL) writing mode which used by Arabic, Hebrew languages among others. When you write RTL you should mirror (simplified explanation!) your site: your logo in the header move to the right side and all of your layout, text alignment also changes place in a similar manner.

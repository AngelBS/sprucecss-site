<p class="lead">In the appendix you can find some reference that inspired or gave any kind of input related to any aspects of Spruce</p>

Creating a framework is a complex task, you need a lot of input. You usually don't invent the wheel, you use the old ideas in a new form. So here is a lot of good resource if you want to know more, it helped a lot for us.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - It may look strange that we reference Bootstrap here because it a (maybe the biggest) CSS framework. The case is, that BS is almost the ultimate truth when it comes to excellent solutions. It a a high standard for us.
- [Layout patterns](https://web.dev/patterns/layout/) - A good source of modern layout examples. Spruce don't use a grid system and we don't plan to implement one. We use Flexbox and Grid.
- [Learn Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design/) - A great resource for modern responsive development. We loved the "Internationalization" section.
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) - A great course on layouts. How to create resopnsive layouts without ```@media``` breakpoints. Although Spruce uses breakpoint we try to reduce their uses as possible.
